# Blazor Bug Tracker

What is a Bug Tracker?
An issue tracking system (also ITS, trouble ticket system, support ticket, request management or incident ticket system) is a computer software package that manages and maintains lists of issues. 
Issue tracking systems are generally used in collaborative settings—especially in large or distributed collaborations—but can also be employed by individuals as part of a time management or personal productivity regime.
These systems often encompass resource allocation, time accounting, priority management, and oversight workflow in addition to implementing a centralized issue registry.

I build this web application by using Blazor, HTML, CSS with a little bit of JavaScript. And data base with PostgresSQL.

What is in my Bug Tracker?

My Bug Tracker has every funtions of a complete production which is ready to use or sell to customer.

My Bug Tracker has Authorization, Authendication, Securities, Create, Adjust Project and Ticket, Assign role to user, Assign ticket to user, Change Ticket's Priority, Status, or Type, Comment on Ticket, Attach file to Ticket and Project, Notification Alert through Email, Message system, and Overview the work of company. This project also have a financial, HR, and payroll system.

As you can see, this is a realize application using real business logic.

This is my biggest project and I put a lot of works on this project. After finished this Bug Tracker, I used it to track other project, and I'm still working on those projects right now. You can see it when you log in with Demo Admin or Demo Project Manager
Notes: If you log in as a Demo User, You can't create or update anything on the database. If you want to see it fully functions, contact me by clicking on the "How to contact me ?" button



In order to test the Bug Tracker, you can simply click on "Login as Demo User" and choose either Admin, Project Manager, Developer, or Submitter. To test all of the Bug Tracker functions, I recommend you to login as Demo Admin.
Different role has different permission to do their work in the system. For example, Admin has every permission on the system, Project Manager have almost every permissions but can't modify the role of Admin. Developer and Submitter only can update ticket and submit file to the system.
